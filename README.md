# Avid CMS

## MISSION: To create an easy-to-use CMS that's modular and runs on a fraction of the code used by the WordPress, the most popular CMS in the world. 

### PHASE I Build:
This build is all about the creation of the MVC architecture and components needed for a fully functional, basic CMS. To expedite development, Laravel will be used. It won't be pretty, but it will work exactly as it should.

### PHASE II:
Review feature requests and create the approved features to be added to the CMS. 

### PHASE III:  
It's all about R&R: Refactor and Refine. The codebase will be submitted for public review with the goal of getting this project to a beta release.

### PHASE IV:
Another round of code testing and review, in preparation for and alpha release. 

### Phase V:
Prepare CMS for Alpha release with an open-source codebase that's made available to the public at no cost. 


## STRATEGY
The development strategy for this CMS is to make it as modular as possible, with modules not included with the core easily downloaded and installed by CLI or GUI interface. The overarching philosophy is to use only what's needd to deliver the features and functionality required by a specific use case. Eventually, different versions of this CMS may exist with builds for specific, common use cases. 

## DETAILS
This CMS is NOT intended to be another drag-and-drop page builder. Rather, it's aimed at use cases where posts, products, and other tyeps of data are easily entered, spreadsheet-style, into an interface and stored in the database. For clients with specific design and branding needs, those will be met by the front end development team. All the client needs to do is enter the information, and _voila_ - a beautiful rendering of the website happens. 

## WHY THIS APPROACH?
For close to a decade, I've worked with various CMS, including WordPress, Shopify, Wix, Squarespace, Webflow, and others. Building a website is still a labor-intensive, difficult process. Most business websites are built with the same basic components, so why are we working so hard to create these websites? Also, when it comes to WordPress, its codebase is bloated and it has idiosyncratic syntax that's unlike any other PHP-based CMS out there (i.e., Drupal, Magento, and others). Wix, Squarespace, and others keep your data and make it difficult to download and transfer to a different website if you decide to move away from them. I believe that a website's data should never be held captive by a hosting provider, no matter how great the claim their CMS is. Whether you're hosting with Wix or you're hosting with me, you should be able to switch hosting providers with minimal effort and no bs. 

## WHAT ABOUT LOSING CONTROL OF THE FRONT END?
The truth is, most clients like DIY...until they start building their own website. A few hours in, maybe a few days, they realize how difficult it is to design and build a website that's attractive and does its job as part of an effective marketing strategy. I contend that 95% of clients don't -- and --shouldn't -- design and build their own websites. They know as much about building a website as I do about brain surgery (which is virtually nothing). Why give them the tools when they have no clue how to use them? 

## WHAT ABOUT CLIENT COST? 
Clients who want a cheap website will find a way to get one, no matter how poor the quality or how poorly it helps drive business growth. Personally, I only want to deal with clients who understand that their website is an investment, one that will deliver huge returns over time. These clients rarely want to personally create and publish blog posts, add new products, or make changes to existing ones. The person or team who's tasked with adding and publishing content wants a simple and quick way to do that. Spreadsheets are common and most people know how to use them, hence this kind of approach for entering the data. The beauty of it is that, if you have a CSV file with 25,000 products or 100,000 blog posts, you can upload it into the CMS, do a little column-matching, and what could take days or weeks is reduced to several minutes, with a process that runs in the backbground until the entiretly of the spreadsheet is added to the database.

## WHY DO THIS FOR FREE?
I believe that people should have access to the tools and products they need to start and grow their business. I also believe that A CMS is something you should be able to learn how to use in a few hours, not weeks or months. 

## WHAT IF I WANT TO HELP?
Help is always appreciated. If you want to volunteer some time to this project, I would be grateful for that. I am a web developer who is striving to transition from a Junior Developer set of skills into a Senior Developer. Help and guidance along these lines is greatly appreciated!
